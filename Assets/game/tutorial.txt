                --Your workspace--
    You will build a program for your first rover in this folder. 
    The file name is rover.lua. You will need to make Lua scripts, the default code is already there. You may use any IDE you like, or just use notepad.
    If you need to see the default code again, just delete the file and reload the menu with code.
    After you upload your code in-game, the code will duplicate in the level folder, so you can revisit your old code and copy some things if you need to.
    
                --Menu with code and level choosing--
    Click on the update button (refresh icon) to upload your code to the game.
    You can select level with arrows on the top right.
    You can also preview the level with an eye icon.
    To start the level, click the arrow in the bottom right.

                --Actual level--
    Use arrows (or A/D) to move the camera.
    Press ESC to return to the code menu.
    Click the arrow on the bottom right to start the next turn.
    The function called depends on the state of the button, you can control it by clicking it (updates once per turn). 
    The arrow beside the button indicates your intentions (click or not to click)
    Position of the hand indicates the current state of the button (clicked or not clicked)

That's about it. Good luck!
